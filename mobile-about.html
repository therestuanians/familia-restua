			Our beloved Restua family has evolved through the years; it has generations 
			that represent how our family has grown up since 1945. Every name, event, 
			and memory were written by our own family history. This is our family history. 
			Our family traced the roots of the child named Benjamin, who is our great-grandfather. 
			He was a homeless child before being adopted by a Chinese family named Restua, from which 
			our surnames or middle names were inherited. After the years, he met and married Serafina 
			Alcantara-Restua, who is our great grandmother, and they have 11 children named Nory, Hermie, 
			Raymundo, Leonardo, Lito, Elvie, Apple, Luz, Sapa, Danilo Sr., and Benser. During the time of 
			the war (World War 2), Benjamin kept his family in safety by hiding in the cave, and our great-grandfather
			Benjamin shot a shrapnel gun by an unknown gunman. Benjamin was a simple businessman before. After his death, 
			they lived with their family peacefully until they married and had children.

			<div class="title">Second Generation (Tagupa - Restua)</div>
			Our grandfather, Leonardo Alcantara-Restua, was a construction worker. 
			He met and married our grandmother, Maria Tagupa-Restua in the city of Manily and they had four children, 
			named Edwin, Jack, Lilibeth, and Anita. The four children were taught by our grandfather the importance of family values 
			such as faithfulness, love, unity, respect, and servanthood. Second-generation family members were disciplined 
			before they followed the rules imposed by their parents as well as Grandpa Leony and Grandma Maria are strict parents
			. Still, they do their best to work and take care of the family and earn a living through laundry services, selling food, 
			and freelance carpentry work. Danilo Restua Jr. who is originally the child of Danilo Restua Sr., has been with the siblings 
			since he was in first grade when Leonardo and Maria took care of him. Leonardo suddenly had a heart attack 
			while he was giving Lilibeth some cash for her work and taking some rest. The whole family rushed him to the Philippine Heart Center, and 
			they did their best to survive his life by pumping his heart until he passed away on June 16, 1996.

			The third generation of family members were once called as "Teammates" started with Jerome Juliano Restua, who was born on November 28, 1994. 
			It was only Jerome who reached the life and death of Leonardo. After the death of Grandpa Leony, 
			members of the third generation increased, including Kathleen Linga Restua (1998), 
			Joan Restua Lalog (June 2000), Joseph Restua and Jefferson Restua (October 2000), 
			Michael Iven Restua Gohilde (2001), Jonard Restua Lalog (May 2002), Jaclyn Ann Juliano Restua (November 2002), 
			Mikaella Ivee Restua Gohilde (2004), Jeneth Restua Lalog (2005), Jhasmin Mae Juliano Restua (2006), 
			Miguel Gabriel Restua Gohilde (2008), and David Nash Linga Restua (2010). Margarette Simon Restua (2014), 
			Samantha Simon Restua (2017) and Adelaine Simon Restua (2023), who are the children of Uncle Danilo and Aunt Mary Anne, 
			were added to the lists of cousins. Since 2017 The entire teammates build the "Fourth Generation" by welcoming acquaintances
			or legalizing romantic relationship of each cousins. Our family persevered with the values and attitudes that our ancestors had left behind 
			through our combined efforts. The Restua family's story is more than simply their past; it's a continuous journey 
			filled with lessons learned, unforgettable moments, and an enduring bond that spans generations.

      <button class="core-close" onclick="closecoreModal(1)">&times;</button>
      <h2>FAITHFULNESS</h2><br>
	  <p>Our first core value is faithfulness. Being a child to our Lord Jesus Christ must be a 
	  principle to every member of this clan. Being faithful to our Lord through doctrines and 
	  dogma could make the clan transformed and love would prevails in the clan. Without the faithfulness 
	  to our lord and savior we will be committed to many sins and there will be no love to manifest 
	  in this clan.</p><br>
	  <ul>
		<li>I will respect the beliefs of our family</li>
		<li>I will be thankful to God for what he has given me and guiding for me everyday</li>
	  </ul>
    </div>

  <div id="coremodal2" class="core-modal">
    <div class="core-modal-content">
      <button class="core-close" onclick="closecoreModal(2)">&times;</button>
      <h2>LOVE</h2><br>
	  <p>Our second core value is love. It is next to the faithfulness of our lord. 
	  According to the certain saying, “A family that loves together stays forever”. 
	  We should manifest the spirit of love in this clan and every member must love his own 
	  brothers or sisters. We are loved by our lord it means we should love our brothers and 
	  sisters in times of crisis or in wealth. Without love manifesting in this family there is no 
	  unity, before going to the spirit of unity love must manifest first.</p><br>
	  <ul>
		<li>I will love and listen my family always</li>
		<li>I will be faithful and loyal to my partner always</li>
		<li>I will be honest and clean to my family and also to the person(s) that surrounds me</li>
	  </ul>

      <button class="core-close" onclick="closecoreModal(3)">&times;</button>
      <h2>RESPECT</h2><br>
	  <p>Our third core value is respect. It is next to the love. Loving the family means 
	  you should also respect your family. Respect implies accepting someone for who they are, 
	  even if they are different from you or have different opinions than you. Respect enhances 
	  emotions of safety, security, and wellbeing in your interactions to the family itself. 
	  We should not only respect the family but also the persons around us and the environment</p><br>
	  <ul>
		<li>I will respect my family and our relatives</li>
		<li>I will give respect to the environment and to the people who deserves my respect</li>
	  </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id="coremodal4" class="core-modal">
    <div class="core-modal-content">
      <button class="core-close" onclick="closecoreModal(4)">&times;</button>
      <h2>UNITY</h2><br>
	  <p>Our third core value is unity. When love and respect manifests in the clan unity must be next. 
	  We are in one blood, one soul and one family. We should unite each other, persons with the same surnames 
	  flock together. A family should and must start with unity in order to connect, define themselves, and 
	  support one another. God has provided parents and children with a wealth of guidance on their interactions 
	  within their homes. We can only manage these connections properly and in a way that pleases the Lord if we 
	  work together as a team.</p><br>
	  <ul>
		<li>I will be one with the ideals and dreams of the family</li>
		<li>I will help my family member without hesitations</li>
		<li>I must know the family background and learn the lesson from it</li>
		<li>I will sympathize with my family when they are facing problems.</li>
	  </ul>

      <button class="core-close" onclick="closecoreModal(5)">&times;</button>
      <h2>SERVANTHOOD</h2><br>
	  <p>Our fourth value is servanthood. Through the manifestation of servanthood in the family we are helping each 
	  other to raise them up. Helping each other in times of need must be seen in the family next to our community. 
	  The family is the smallest unit of the society thus servanthood must applied in the clan first. 
	  By manifesting servanthood we are able to help in the persons that surrounds us.</p><br>
	  <ul>
		<li>I will be a law - abiding family member</li>
		<li>I should give accountability to my obligations</li>
		<li>I will be accountable to my actions that I have done</li>
